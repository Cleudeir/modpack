[14:17:54] [Render thread/ERROR]: Failed to find any frequency-related placement options for feature json {"feature":"zombie_extreme:ruin_2","placement":[]}
[14:17:54] [Render thread/ERROR]: While most features have frequency options, some do not. Likewise, some mods might use their own custom frequency options. Please use /dumpfeature <feature name> (not yet implemented) to produce an editable file under <mod directory>/worldgenrevisited and manually edit the file there. Then, please add this feature to the list of features to remove (optional). WorldgenRevisited will then load your edited feature in place of the original feature. You can add new frequency options to any feature, even if they do not come with placement options by default.
